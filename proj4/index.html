    <h1>Project 4: Image Warping and Mosaicing</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Back to Main Page</a>
    <h2>Part 1: Shooting Pictures and Defining Correspondences</h2>
    <p>The first part of this project was to shoot pictures. I was kind of lazy about this so I just shot some pictures of my room and of Soda.
        The most important part about this step is to make sure that when taking the pictures, we should only rotate the camera around its axis,
        and not do any translations. This is because otherwise it becomes impossible to find a common surface to which we can project the 
        images onto, and there will be no affine transformation. I shot three images for each mosaic, making sure to keep at least 40-70% image 
        overlap for each camera rotation. I then defined correspondences between sequential images using the tool from project 3.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2: Calculating Homographies</h2>
    <p>Using the correspondences defined above, we can calculate an affine transformation matrix to go from one image to another. Below is 
        an image explaining how we calculate the transformation matrix given the correspondence points.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="media/alec_li_homography.png" style="width:800px">
        <figcaption>I did the exact same thing as <a target='_blank' href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/upload/files/proj4A/alec.li/">Alec Li (Fall 2023 CS 180)</a> and thought it would be a waste to rewrite everything, so I'm 
            just using his explanation since it looks nice.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    Technically, since there are 8 unknowns, we only need 4 correspondences because each correspondence generates two equations as shown above. However, this could lead to
    an unstable transformation matrix calculation, so it's better to have an overdetermined system which is why I defined 8 correspondences between my images. I calculated the 
    homographies from the side images to the center images, since I'm using the center image as my reference

    <h2>Part 3: Warping Images</h2>
    <p>The next task is to actually apply the homographies to the relevant images and warp them into the space of the reference image.
        <ol>
            <li>First, we need to calculate the bounding box of the warped image. To do this, we apply the homography to the corners of the original image,
                and find the difference between the max(x) - min(x) and max(y) - min(y) to determine the minimum bounding box.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, because some of the warped corners might be negative/out of frame, we want to translate this bounding box so that the warped image's top
                left corner will be at 0,0. The offset is just min(x) and min(y) so we simply subtract that offset from the warped corners
            </li>
            <li>
                From here, it's essentially the same process as project 3, instead of warping each triangle, this time we can create a polygon using the warped
                and shifted corners and then interpolate the color values accordingly. So it's like we're warping the entire image at once, rather than triangular patches.
            </li>
            <li>
                We also add a mask to make sure that we are only interpolating from pixels that exist in the original image, and everything outside that mask
                is going to be 0 (black pixel).
            </li>
        </ol>
        Here are some examples of warped images:

    <h2>Part 4: Image Rectification</h2>
    <p>To test out my warp function, I rectified some objects by selecting the corners of the objects and then setting the correspondences 
        to some box like (0,0), (100, 0), (100, 100), (0, 100). From here I calculated the relevant homography for my warp function.</p>

    <h2>Part 5: Blending Warped Images into a Mosaic</h2>
    <p>This part required us to align the warped images with the reference image and create a mosaic. My naive approach was just to:
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the right image with the reference image. First, calculate a bounding box for this "right mosaic" by finding the max
                between the warped image's size and the reference image shifted by the right image's offset.
            </li>
            <li>Place the warped right image at the top right corner of the bounding box</li>
            <li>Translate the reference image from the top right corner using the right image's offset</li>
            <li>Place the reference image at the specified place (overlapping with part of the warped right image)</li>
            <li>Now, we need to add the warped left image to our right mosaic. We first calculate the bounding box for the 
                entire mosaic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shift the warped left image down by left offset - right offset.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shift the right mosaic right be -left offset.
            </li>
        </ol>
        I create a "left mosaic" too, just to see whether that might be easier.
        This naive approach didn't work because the overlap was not exactly aligned, so it created weird artifacts and you could see 
        edge lines from the images. Additionally, because I was simply overlaying the images on top of each other,
        some parts of the image were brighter than others. See the examples below:
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="media/soda_final_images/soda_old_left_mosaic.png" style="width:500px">

        <figcaption>(Bad) Soda Mosaic</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>To solve these issues, I used Laplacian blending from project 2 instead of just overlaying the images on top of each other.
        For the mask, I just had a binary mask where the split point was in the middle of the overlapping region of the images.
        This greatly improved the quality of the mosaic and removed almost all artifacts. Here are 3 examples below:

    <h1>Project 4B: Automatic Image Stitching</h1>
    <p>In this part of the project, the idea is to automatically detect corners in the image, form correspondences between pairs of images,
        and then select the best correspondences for the most stable homographies. This way, we don't have to manually select the correspondence
        points.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Detecting Corners in an Image</h2>
    <p>In the first step, we want to find some points that generally resemble corners as these will provide a strong starting point for
        discovering correspondences. To do this, we use the Harris corner detector (provided to us in the spec), which returns a number
        of candidate corner points, as well as the 'corner-y-ness' of each pixel in the image. I decided to use a black and white image
        to detect the corners as that was suggested in the spec. I ended up with around 6600 corners.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="media/part_b_images/soda_left_harris_corners.png" style="width:800px">
        <figcaption>Harris Corners</figcaption>
    </figure>

        <img src="media/part_b_images/soda_left_harris_heatmap.png" style="width:800px">
        <figcaption>Harris Heatmap</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We can see that the heatmap makes sense since it seems to follow the basic geometry of the image - the shape of the image
        kind of slants towards the right side.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression</h2>
    <p>For this step, we extract the strongest corners that are not too close to other "strongest" corners, in essentials. We start by 
        sorting the candidate points in descending order of their strength values, obtained from the Harris strength array. 
        It then calculates pairwise distances between all points using the dist2 helper function. For each point in this sorted list, 
        the function calculates a "suppression radius" (r-value), which is the minimum distance to any previously processed point 
        with a strength value that exceeds a fraction (c_robust) of the current point's strength. This ensures that only points that 
        are sufficiently strong and spatially distinct from stronger points are retained. After calculating the suppression radius for 
        each point, the points are ranked by their r-values. The larger the r-value, the stronger of a corner that point is (because
        its strength is greater than all the other candidates within that radius). Optionally, we can take the top-k points from this 
        ordered list instead of just returning the entire thing. I chose to take only the top 200 ANMS points, shown below.
    </p>

        <figcaption>Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression Corners (Blue Points)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Step 3: Feature Extraction</h2>
    <p>The overall idea is that we want to find corresponding corners between images. To do this, we need to find a way to match 
        the corners
